# Lafayette-Case

In this comprehensive project, I undertook an in-depth analysis to uncover the key drivers of brand equity for Galeries Lafayette. The goal was to understand how customers perceive the brand and how these perceptions influence their loyalty and commitment.

Starting with the provided dataset of 553 customer responses, I first reorganized the data and conducted a thorough analysis of missing values. To explore the underlying dimensions of customer perception, I performed both Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). This process involved applying tests like the Bartlett test, KMO measure, and Anti-Image matrix, as well as using the Scree-test and Kaiser criterion to determine the appropriate number of factors. I then carried out Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to further refine the model.

Following this, I evaluated both local and global fit to ensure the robustness of the measurement model. Finally, I conducted path analysis to explore the relationships between these factors and key outcomes such as customer loyalty and commitment. The findings provided valuable insights, leading to actionable recommendations for Galeries Lafayette to enhance their brand equity and strengthen customer relationships.
